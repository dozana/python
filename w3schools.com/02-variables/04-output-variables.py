# Output Variables
x = "Python is awesome"
print(x)

print("------")

# In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:
# The best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to separate them with commas, which even support different data types:
x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)

print("------")

# You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:
# Notice the space character after "Python " and "is ", without them the result would be "Pythonisawesome".
x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "awesome"
print(x + y + z)

print("------")
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)
